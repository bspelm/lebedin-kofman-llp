                            </p><h2>Healthcare Fraud Lawyers</h2><p>There are many ways that healthcare professionals, insurance companies, and medical facilities can be accused of fraud and abuse. These claims are taken very seriously by local and federal law enforcement agencies. If you or your business receives a request for medical or billing records, a visit from a federal investigator or FBI agent, or if matters have already progressed to an indictment or a grand jury subpoena, you should immediately consult with highly experienced <a href="https://www.lebedinkofman.com/practice-areas/criminal-defense/fraud/healthcare-fraud/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">healthcare fraud attorneys</a>.
<br>
<br>A conviction for healthcare fraud can destroy a career and a business. It can also result in jail time, loss of license to practice, and severe fines. In addition, an alleged conviction can affect your ability to obtain future healthcare benefits and insurance.
<br>
<br>Healthcare fraud cases often involve a complex matrix of laws, regulations, policies, and protocols. If you or your business are facing allegations of Medicare or Medicaid fraud, a skilled healthcare fraud attorneys can help protect your professional reputation and your livelihood.
<br>
<br>An experienced criminal attorney who is devoted to defending clients against charges of healthcare fraud will fight to preserve your professional license and your freedom from incarceration, and can aggressively negotiate with the prosecutor to get the best possible outcome in your case.
<br>
<br>A Medicaid fraud case involves submitting false claims for government-funded medical treatment, prescription drug reimbursements, or other monetary benefits. A felony conviction for Medicaid fraud can result in substantial penalties, including fines and jail time. It can also jeopardize your eligibility for federal programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Consulting with healthcare fraud attorneys is crucial in these situations.
<br>
<br>Medicare and Medicaid are two of the most popular healthcare programs in the United States, providing healthcare coverage to low-income individuals and seniors. These government-funded programs are a critical resource for New York City residents in need of medical treatment that they cannot afford on their own. Unfortunately, these programs are frequently misused for personal gain by unscrupulous medical professionals and their employees. Healthcare fraud attorneys can assist in addressing these concerns.
<br>
<br>There are several common forms of Medicare and Medicaid fraud that can occur. For example, a physician or hospital can submit fraudulent claims for unnecessarily expensive prescription drugs. Another form of Medicare and Medicaid fraud involves pharmacies and pharmaceutical manufacturers engaging in illegal kickback schemes. This occurs when a pharmaceutical manufacturer gives a discount to a chain drug store in exchange for the pharmacy’s reselling of the medication at inflated prices to Medicaid and Medicare recipients. Seeking advice from healthcare fraud attorneys is advisable in these situations.
<br>
<br>Attorneys with extensive experience in handling fraud and abuse cases related to healthcare, insurance, no-fault and workers’ compensation, mail and wire fraud, money laundering, securities fraud, trademark counterfeiting, and bribery and illegal kickbacks are essential. They represent individual and corporate clients in all stages of federal, state, and local investigations, grand jury proceedings, administrative disciplinary matters, and criminal prosecutions. They have a successful track record in defending clients against allegations of Medicare fraud, Medicaid fraud, and insurance fraud. In addition, they have represented whistleblowers in False Claims Act lawsuits on behalf of private citizens and the government. A consultation with a healthcare fraud attorneys can provide guidance in these complex legal matters.

                            </p><h2>New York Health Fraud Defense Attorneys</h2><p>When a person is accused of Medicare or Medicaid fraud, the allegations are serious and must be taken seriously by experienced healthcare fraud attorneys. These cases involve alleged violations of federal and state law that carry severe penalties if a person is convicted. The consequences of a conviction of fraud in the third degree, first degree, or other New York Penal Law Article 177 offense can ruin medical careers and destroy professional reputations.
<br>
<br>New York’s Medicaid system is a state and federal program that provides healthcare services to low-income individuals and families. When the system is compromised by fraud, this impedes access to healthcare services and increases costs for taxpayers. Consequently, local and state authorities take allegations of Medicaid fraud extremely seriously and are hyper-vigilant in investigating these types of crimes.
<br>
<br>As a result, doctors and other healthcare professionals who are accused of these crimes face extensive investigation and prosecution by local, state, and federal investigators. Healthcare fraud attorneys in New York can provide a strong legal defense to these allegations and protect your career and reputation. Moreover, a medical professional facing such investigations may be subject to the suspension or revocation of their license by New York’s Office of the Professions, the authoritative body that handles licensing matters for all medical professions.
<br>
<br>Skilled healthcare fraud attorneys can demonstrate that the alleged misconduct was merely an honest mistake and that you did not know that your actions constituted a crime. In addition, a top New York healthcare fraud lawyer can often convince prosecutors to drop charges or reduce a felony charge to a misdemeanor, thus sparing you prison time and preserving your medical career.
<br>
<br>The most important aspect of a criminal defense in a Medicare or Medicaid fraud case is to act quickly and retain knowledgeable healthcare fraud attorneys. It is never wise to attempt to deal with these complex issues on your own, as even an innocent mistake can be framed as fraudulent or forgery. Experienced healthcare fraud attorneys can navigate these complex legal waters and provide the best possible defense.

                            </p><h2>Healthcare Fraud Legal Help NY</h2><p>The United States Department of Justice’s Criminal Division’s Health Care Fraud Unit is comprised of over 80 experienced white-collar prosecutors who specialize in prosecuting the nation’s most complex and sensitive healthcare fraud matters. These prosecutors prosecute a wide variety of healthcare fraud crimes, including the illegal prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances (such as opioids), Medicare and Medicaid fraud, and physician over-prescribing, among others. If you are the subject of a federal healthcare fraud investigation, it is imperative to consult with healthcare fraud attorneys immediately.
<br>
<br>A conviction of a healthcare fraud crime can be devastating, not only because of the significant penalties for such crimes (up to and including prison time) but also because such a conviction can jeopardize your professional license. Having a New York City healthcare fraud lawyer who has experience representing physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other professionals in federal prosecutions is critical to navigating these complex legal challenges.
<br>
<br>Defending against allegations of Medicaid fraud or Medicare fraud requires an attorney who is knowledgeable about New York state laws, federal regulations, and the various forms of this type of fraud. Experienced healthcare fraud attorneys in New York will be able to identify potential defenses and work on minimizing any collateral consequences to your professional license.
<br>
<br>New York has five specific statutes relating to healthcare fraud. These include the fifth-degree offense, which applies to individuals who knowingly and willfully engage in a scheme or plan to defraud any healthcare benefit program or insurance company by giving or withholding information. In such cases, NYC healthcare fraud attorneys can provide invaluable assistance in understanding these statutes and formulating a defense strategy.
<br>
<br>The healthcare fraud statutes are broad, and consulting healthcare fraud attorneys early on, even before an investigation has begun, is important. It is common for an investigator to request subpoenas and interview people without specifying whether they are investigating a civil matter or a criminal matter. The early involvement of New York healthcare fraud attorneys can make the difference between having your case dismissed or being charged with a felony conviction.

<br>
<br>Getting arrested is scary enough, but it’s even worse when you’re unsure what’s going to happen next. Depending on the nature of your case, you could end up with a jail sentence or a fine. That’s why it’s important to consult with a reputable criminal lawyer as soon as you think that you are in trouble with the law. A good NYC criminal lawyer can help you through every step of the criminal process, from preventing your arrest to fighting for a dismissal or reduction in charges.
<br>
<br>A sex crime can have a devastating impact on your career, reputation, and personal relationships. In addition to potential incarceration and a criminal record, you may have to register as a sexual offender under SORA (Sex Offender Registration Act). This can have a long-lasting negative effect on your life, which is why it’s essential that you seek out a capable violent crime lawyer immediately. An experienced NYC criminal lawyer can offer you the best chance at navigating these complex legal challenges.
<br>
<br>A criminal investigation can begin when something happens that catches the attention of a law enforcement agency, such as a tip from a third party or an observation by a police officer. From there, the case can go through numerous reports and actions by one or many individuals in law enforcement who have different motivations, observations, and roles. Eventually, the case will reach the District Attorney, who files criminal charges in local courts across the state. In such scenarios, having a skilled NYC criminal lawyer can be vital in effectively addressing and countering the prosecutorial efforts.&nbsp;<br></p>
